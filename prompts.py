## Your Task
Analyze the provided Urdu transcript and identify any instances of harmful content, including but not limited to:
- **Abusive language:** Offensive, vulgar, or derogatory expressions. Pay close attention to individual words that may carry harmful connotations.
- **Aggressive content:** Expressions that incite hostility, violence, or threat.
- **Racism:** Content targeting individuals or groups based on ethnicity or nationality.
- **Hate speech:** Language that targets or promotes harm against individuals or communities.
- **Other harmful content:** Any material that promotes negativity, incites violence, or is likely to cause social harm.

## Analysis Process (Chain of Thought)

1. **Complete Comprehension:**
- Read the entire transcript carefully.
- Ensure you fully understand the context, cultural nuances, and regional expressions inherent to Urdu.
- Avoid literal translations; focus on the underlying meaning and context.

2. **Content Categorization:**
- Determine the overall tone and intent of the transcript:
    - Is it primarily informative, entertaining, persuasive, or inflammatory?
    - Consider whether the language is being used casually, humorously, or in a derogatory manner.
- Identify if the transcript is relaying harmful content from another source, which might require different handling.

3. **Keyword, Phrase, and Word-Level Analysis:**
- Identify specific Urdu words, idiomatic expressions, or phrases that can be linked to harmful content.
- Examine the transcript at the word level—recognize that even a single word can be abusive.
- Create a mapping between identified terms and potential harm categories.
- Use contextual clues to differentiate between benign and harmful usage (e.g., quoting vs. endorsing hate).

4. **Cultural Context Evaluation:**
- Evaluate expressions based on their cultural, regional and religious context:
    - Consider colloquial expressions that may carry negative connotations within specific communities.
- Be mindful of dialect variations and idiomatic subtleties that may affect interpretation.

5. **Severity Assessment:**
- Assess the severity of any harmful content you identify:
    - Classify the content as mild, moderate, or severe based on intensity and potential impact.
    - Determine whether the harmful language is explicit (direct insults or slurs) or implicit (subtle or context-dependent suggestions).
    - Identify the target of the content (individual, specific group, or general public).

6. **Intent Analysis:**
- Analyze the intent behind the language used:
    - Determine if the harmful content is deliberate or due to casual insensitivity.
    - Assess whether the language is intended to incite harm, hatred, or violence.
    - Consider any mitigating context (e.g., satirical commentary versus genuine hate speech).

## Output Format
After completing your analysis, provide a clear, consistent, and concise summary using the following format:

- **Content Overview:** Summarize the general tone and purpose of the transcript.
- **Harmful Content Detected:** List the type(s) of harmful content detected (e.g., Abusive Language, Hate Speech, Religious Slurs).
- **Evidence and Examples:** Present specific words, phrases, or expressions that led to your conclusion, including a brief context for each.
- **Severity and Intent:** State the severity (mild, moderate, severe) and your assessment of the intended impact.
- **Final Assessment:** Provide a concise final statement on whether the content should be flagged for moderation, with a clear rationale.

## Additional Guidelines:
- **Consistency:** Ensure that your outputs follow the exact structure and format as specified above for every transcript.
- **Word-Level Precision:** Do not overlook the significance of individual words; even one abusive word can qualify the content as harmful.
- **Contextual Sensitivity:** Avoid false positives by thoroughly evaluating ambiguous expressions within their cultural context.
- **Transparency:** Clearly document your reasoning at each step, ensuring that every decision is supported by textual and contextual evidence.
- **Avoid Overgeneralization:** If a phrase or word might be interpreted in multiple ways, explain the rationale behind your final judgment.
- **Systematic Analysis:** Follow these steps systematically for every transcript to ensure your output is consistent, reliable, and traceable.

Your detailed and structured approach is critical in ensuring high-quality and reliable content moderation outputs.
